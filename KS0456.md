# 3.Introduction

( 1 ) What is Micro:bit?

Designed by BBC, Micro:bit main board aims to help children aged above 10 years old to have a better learning of programming.

It is equipped with loads of components,including a 5\*5 LED dot matrix, 2 programmable buttons, a compass, a Micro USB interface and a Bluetooth module and others. Though it is just the size of a credit card, it boasts multiple functions. To name just a few, it can be applied in programming video games, making interactions between light and sound, controlling a robot, conducting scientific experiments, developing wearable devices and make some cool inventions like robots and musical instruments, basically everything imaginable.

This new version, that’s version 2.0, of Micro:bit main board has a touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone. And there is a buzzer built in the other side of the board which makes playing all kinds of sound possible without any external equipment. The golden fingers and gears added provide a better fixing of crocodile clips. Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower the power consumption of battery and it can be entered if users long press the Reset & Power button on the back of it. More importantly, the CPU capacity of this version is much better than that of the V1.5 and the V2 has more RMA.

In final analysis, the Micro:bit main board V2 can allow customers to explore more functions so as to make more innovative products.

Serving as a better device for learning some basic knowledge about microcontroller and electronics, this sensor kit is designed by Keyestudio to help programming enthusiasts enter this wonderful world. This kit consists of a micro:bit control board and some common sensors and modules. In application, we can plug a shield in with DC7-9V to power not only the Micro bit board but also the sensors/ modules. And the shield can be connected by jumper cap to control the voltage of ports V1 and V2 used to supply power for sensors. We plan to provide instructions for using this board and sensors/ modules, including offering connection diagrams and test code.

( 2 ) Comparison between V2.0 & V1.5

**Micro:bit main Board V2.0**：

**More details:**

![](./media/image-20230413140339803.png)

For the Micro: Bit main board V2, pressing the Reset & Power button , it will reset the Micro: Bit and rerun the program. If you hold it tight, the red LED will slowly get darker. When the power indicator flickers into darkness, releasing the button and your Micro: Bit board will enter sleep mode for power saving .This will make your battery more durable. And you could press this button again to ‘wake up’ your Micro:bit.

( 4 )Notes for the application of Micro:bit main board V2.0

a.It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.

b.Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large current,such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore, you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a Micro:bit shield.

c.It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: Bit expansion board is required.

d.When using pins(P3、P4、P6、P7、P10)shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and the data about sensors maybe wrong.

e.The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the main board will be damaged.

f. Forbid to use it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a micro computer which has made programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And about programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/> which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

# 4.Install Micro:bit Driver

If you have downloaded micro:bit driver, then no need to download it again.

If it is you first time to use micro:bit main board, then you will have to download the driver.

First of all, connect the micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.

And enter the link https://fs.keyestudio.com/KS0456 to download the driver file of micro:bit, ![](media/7da14a3ddf6fcb34e7f18954eff038ae.png).

# 5.Getting Started with Micro:bit

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as a reference if you are using a different system.

5.1 Write code and program

This chapter describes how to write program with the App Micro: Bit and load the program to the Micro: Bit main board V2.

You are recommended to browse the official website of Micro:bit for more details, and the link is attached below:

[https://microbit.org/guide/quick/](Https://microbit.org/guide/quick/)

**Step 1: connect the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer**

Firstly, link the Micro: Bit main board V2 with your computer via the USB cable.Macs、PCs、 Chromebooks and Linux （including Raspberry Pi）systems are all compatible with the Micro: Bit main board V2.

Note that if you are about to pair the board with your phone or tablet, please refer to this link:

<https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/>

![](./media/image-20230413140807742.png)

Secondly, if the red LED on the back of the board is on, that means the board is powered. Then Micro: Bit main board V2 will appear on your computer as a driver named 'MICROBIT'. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown below.

![](media/a2b53f93f4c24b81fc5cdb5986fd100d.png)

**Step 2: writing programs**

View the link https://makecode.microbit.org/ in your browser;

Click ‘New Project’;

The dialog box ‘Create a Project’ appears, fill it with ‘heartbeat’ and click ‘Create √’ to edit.

(If you are running Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. And the link to the APP is https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab


![](media/397bd09e4c2baf3c933857f3d0d1b83f.png)

![](media/5427d2c4fbb30ffdbce2fe9315244245.png)

Write a set of micro:bit code. You can drag some modules in the Blocks to the editing area and then run your program in Simulator of MakeCode editor as shown in the picture below which demonstrates how to edit ‘heartbeat’ program .

As for loading test code , please turn to Chapter 5.5.

And introduction of Makecode is on the next chapter 5.2.

![](media/a6aa8681158ce5b64ffba50c1238f8c8.png)

**Step 3: download test code**

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write program, what you will have to do to download the program to your Micro: Bit main board V2 is merely clicking the ‘Download’ button, then all is done.

If you are writing programs through the website, following these steps:

Click the ‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact program format that the Micro: Bit main board can read.Once the hexadecimal file is downloaded, copy it to your board V2 just like the process that you copy the file to the USB drive. If you are running Windows system, you can also right-click and select ‘Send to → Microbit (E) ‘to copy the hex file to the Micro: Bit main board V2

![](media/a81d4430eb152346d13bf67b2233b9db.png)

You can also directly drag the "hex" file onto the MICROBIT (E) disk.

![](media/fe0f2de72ba0b38f00403f1aaef7f514.png)

![](media/b4f3602c0e192646f77b150e2acaf947.png)

During the process of copying the downloaded hex file to the Micro: Bit main board V2, the yellow signal light on the back side of the board flashes. When the copy is completed, the yellow signal light will stop flashing and remain on.

**Step 4: run the program**

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2, you could still power it via the USB cable or change to via an external power. The 5 x 5 LED dot matrix on the board displays the heartbeat pattern.

![](./media/image-20230413141024302.png)                  ![image-20230413141049685](./media/image-20230413141049685.png)       

​         micro USB cable                                                     external power（3V）

**Step 5：other programming languages**

This chapter has described how to use the Micro: Bit main board V2.

But except for the Makecode graphical programming introduced you can also write Micro: Bit programs in other languages. Go to the link: <https://microbit.org/code/> to know about other programming languages , or view the link: <https://microbit.org/projects/>, to find something you want to have a go.

5.2 Makecode

Browse <https://makecode.microbit.org/> and enter Makecode online editor or open the APP MakeCode for micro:bit of Windows 10.

![](media/306e32b77a5dae6927b5dd0f6cf6f4f4.png)

Click“New Project”, and input“heartbeat”，then enter Makecode editor, as shown below:

![](./media/image-20230413141402761.png)

There are blocks“on start”and“forever”in the code editing area.

When the power is plugged or reset,“on start”means that the code in the block only executes once, while“forever”implies that the code runs cyclically.

5.3.Quick Download

As mentioned before, if your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode for micro:bit to write programs, the program written can be quickly downloaded to the Micro: Bit main board V2 by selecting ‘Download’.

While it is a little more trickier if you are using a browser to enter makecode. However, if you use Google Chrome, suitable for Linux，macOS and Windows 10, the process can be quicker too.

## **Project 6: Geomagnetic Sensor**

![](./media/image-20230413144332597.png)

**( 1 )Project Description:**

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the attitude heading
reference system (AHRS). 

Micro: Bit main board V2 uses LSM303AGR geomagnetic sensor, and the dynamic range of magnetic field is ±50 gauss. In the board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and compass. In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the original data of the magnetometer will be checked.

The main component of a common compass is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and point toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South Pole) to determine direction.

**( 2 )Components Needed:**

**( 4 )Test Results 1：**

After uploading test code to micro:bit main board V2 and powering the board via the USB cable, and pressing the button A, the board asks us to calibrate compass and the LED dot matrix shows “TILT TO FILL SCREEN”. Then enter the calibration page. Rotate the board until all 25 LEDs are on red as shown below.

![](./media/image-20230413144832449.png)

After that, a smile pattern![](./media/image-20230413144838473.png) appears, which implies the calibration is done. When the calibration process is completed, pressing the button A will make the magnetometer reading display directly on the screen. And the direction north, east, south and west correspond to 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°.

**Coding**

So now let's move to coding. Let us see how to code the LED to flash. Below are some steps to follow.

Open the [https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) to write your code.

Microsoft MakeCode is actually a platform that allows us to code with a micro:bit, and also provides an interactive simulator where we can debug and run our code, and will be able to see what to expect out right there on the site.

Go to MakeCode and choose **My Projects** and click on **New Projects**.

If you want to see the codes behind, then you can click on JavaScript and it will display JavaScript code there in IDE.

![](media/4de590a8489963cb1b0bf67cb20dd415.png)

**LED Flashes**

Let's get started and code the LED to flash. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(false)** into **on start** block.

![](media/41eec8553a4811fb6fb149d737fb3e1d.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

Go to the **Pins**, drag and drop the **digital write pin(P0) to (0)** block into **forever** block.

![](media/2826010318a0ef4893800476078b7004.png)

Look back at the connection diagram, we connect the signal pin to P0. So we select the **P0** in the code; and change the 0 to **1**, which means input a **HIGH** level to the pin so as to **lit** the LED.

![](media/bdc449e43af85561690228630acace9b.png)

Then we can duplicate the block and change the value to **0**, means input a **LOW** level to the pin to **turn off** the LED.

If we want to make the LED keep ON for a few seconds, able to add a **pause (ms)** block. This delay period is in milliseconds, so if you want the LED display as fast, change the value, try 500ms.

![](media/f45ae2bd8ed0bf529ffa51ec8ebdefd0.png)

![](media/f9a41f94fc996d3fc3d76f5ff9c1f77a.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’vewritten.

![](media/3f961280e9729c26de5b0a8e3f173060.png)

**RGB LED Flashes**

Let's get started and code RGB LED to shine three colors. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(false)** into **on start** block.

![](media/41eec8553a4811fb6fb149d737fb3e1d.png)

Go to the **Pins**, drag and drop the **analog write pin(P0) to (1023)** block into **forever** block. Duplicate this block twice, and change the pin to **P1**, **P2**.

![](media/b2c0a6b2a3d5216403dfae2fed2f0a70.png)

Look at the connection diagram, **we separately connect the Red,Green, Blue pin to P1, P2, P0. Connect the V pin to 3.3V.**

So we first set all the pin value to 1023, which means input a **HIGH** level 3.3V (no voltage difference) to **turn off** all the LEDs;

![](media/0d30705269e818f84409b14be850c70d.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

We duplicate and drag the **analog write pin(P0) to (1023)** block into the **forever** block. Change the P0 value to **0**, which means input a **LOW** level (0V)(with voltage difference) so as to **lit** the Blue LED.

Add a **pause** block in millisecond; and then duplicate the **analog write pin(P0) to (1023)** block several times.

We first turn on the Blue LED (P0) for 1 second then off, followed by turn Red LED (P1) on for 1 second then off; and turn Green LED (P2) on for 1 second then off.

![](media/0d30705269e818f84409b14be850c70d.png)

Now let's move on code the program we’ve written. Go to make the RGB led change in different brightness.

Go to **Loops**, drag and drop the **repeat()times do()** block into the block just made. Repeat 1 times.

![](media/d17953bf5e14d8f59e970df38da4a802.png)

Then we drag the block **for (index) from 0 to (4) do** into the **repeat()times do()** block; and set to the variable **val** from 0 to **512**.

![](media/9122aba66e5b5503ea37f550dca8417c.png)

After that, duplicate the **analog write pin** block three times; then call the **Variables** and **Math** block.

![](media/f97dda96d74951edb4135d8f6efff3ef.png)
![](media/be58696330163ce14a776f4f92c6f935.png)

Using the variables adjust the RGB color-ratio to make the color change.

![](media/0d30705269e818f84409b14be850c70d.png)

Finally we duplicate and set the **analog write pin** **2, 1, 0** value to 1023, which means input a **HIGH** level (no voltage difference) to **turn off** all the LEDs.

You can click on **JavaScript** and it will display JavaScript code there in IDE.

![](media/49c104f4654b578780bcaae075c2ec94.png)

![](media/cf34a2f779379a757da6dabad7732a35.png)

**PIR Motion Sensing**

Let's get started and show icons on micro:bit when detects someone moving nearby. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(true)** into **on start** block.

![](media/fc7fef7672d552ebcb19894ac91e17b8.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Logic** and search for **if (true) then...else...**block.

Drag this logic conditional block into **forever** block.

And add a comparison block to the logic conditional block.

![](media/c213ae91e2360d9dbc0df8e493679f5e.png)

![](media/33d4fe1e5f660ea316d2061d416dc0e8.png)

![](./media/image-20230413153428383.png)

Go to the **Pins**, drag and drop the **digital read pin(P0)** block into **if (0)=(1) then...else...**block, replacing the “**0**” field.

![](media/de5a1a7498d8e217ff5670ebb35ca505.png)

Look back at the connection diagram, we connect the signal pin to P0. So we select the **P0** in the code; and input **1**, which means input a **HIGH** level to the pin so as to **lit** the LED.

And then again go to **Basic** and drag the **show leds** block beneath the logic block you just made. Otherwise show another icon.

You can draw an image on the LED screen as you wish.

**![](./media/image-20230413153451932.png)**

After completing this step micro:bit will restart itself and run the code. It will display icons on the simulator. Quite easy? Yeah, quite easy. So let's move on and name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/4de590a8489963cb1b0bf67cb20dd415.png)

**Analog Value Display**

Let's get started and display the analog value of microphone sound on micro:bit. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and again go to **Basic** and click **more** to drag the block **clear screen** out; means turn off all LEDs.

![](media/27eb415d659987f041d31b14cc2f8770.png)

Now go to the **Basic** and scroll down to see a **forever** and **show number(0)** block. Drag the **forever** block beneath the **on start** block.
And drag the **show number(0)** block into the **forever** block.

Go to **Pins**, drag and drop the block **analog read pin(P0)** into  **shownumber(0)** block, replacing the “**0**” field.

![](./media/image-20230413153739398.png)

Next, we go to **Serial**, drag and drop the block **serial write value(x)=(0)** In this way it can write the sound value to the serial port and show it on monitor.

![](media/289be0ae6122b49e6e791acbf5d4a262.png)

Change the “**x**” to **noise** and duplicate the block **analog read pin(P0)** to replace the “**0**” field.

![](media/a268e3681c89136f77ca0ff5746b04e0.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/293cad1aa20498c434b8f082aa5e05fd.png)

In the forever block, we set to output 2 kinds of square wave of different frequencies, so as to output a tone of corresponding frequency.

First, set a variable to output 80 pulse square wave, with a period of 2 milliseconds, and the frequency is 500 Hz, so the passive buzzer outputs 500 Hz frequency sound for 160 milliseconds.

Then delay 100 milliseconds.

And set to output 100 pulse square wave, with a period of 4 milliseconds, and the frequency is 250Hz, so the passive buzzer outputs 250Hz frequency sound for 400 milliseconds.

**Code 1:**

![](./media/image-20230413154116849.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/2826010318a0ef4893800476078b7004.png)

Look at the connection diagram, **we separately connect the Red,Green, Blue pin to P1, P2, P3. The white LED’s signal pin to P0.**

So we first set the white LED’s signal pin value to **1**, which means input a **HIGH** level to **turn on** the white LED. Set to 0 to turn it off.

The RGB pins are active at **LOW (record 0)**, which means set to 0 to turn on; so we can set the RGB pins to **HIGH (record 1)** to turn off.

If you want the LED flash as fast, add a **pause** block in millisecond, try 200ms.

Now we separately turn the white LED (P0) on for 1 second then off, followed by turn Red LED (P1) on for 1 second then off; turn Green LED (P2) on for 1 second then off; turn the Blue LED (P3) on for 1 second then off.

**Test Code:**

![](media/de5a1a7498d8e217ff5670ebb35ca505.png)

Look back at the connection diagram, we connect the button’s signal pin to P0, LED’s signal pin to P1. So if set the **P0** to **1**, means the button is pressed, then set the **P1** to **1**, means input a **HIGH** level to **lit** the LED. Or else, do the contrary action, release the button to turn the led off.

![](./media/image-20230413154820008.png)

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable.

![](media/ea00c6120db0f5dfd3e433d23f69c772.png)

**Test Code**

Open the [https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) to write your code. Or can direct download and send the micro:bit.hex file to your micro:bit.

![](./media/image-20230413155044949.png)

**Code Explanation:**

Look back at the connection diagram, we have connected the touch module to **P0**; **Red, Green, Blue LED to P1, P2, P3**.

The RGB pins are active at **LOW (record 0)**, which means set to 0 to turn on; so we can set the RGB pins to **HIGH (record 1)** to turn off.

On start block, we initially set the variables **flag** and **count** block to 0;

![](./media/image-20230413155112873.png)![](./media/image-20230413155118993.png)

For the forever block, when detects the touch signal, we set the **flag** to 1, and add 10ms block for delay;

![](media/ef81dfbc1a42a9853b764d68cb1f36af.png)

If **flag** equals to 1, run the **flag** to 0, set **count** plus 1;

![](media/359ef56fe68311245d39ccc89028b42a.png)

If **count** equals to 0, run the action that RGB light turns on red;

![](media/b31c2bed0ef1f94a872bfbbe25f242ea.png)

If **count** equals to 1, run the action that RGB light turns on green;

![](media/e38e19667ea25e0a0b604929abd372da.png)

If **count** equals to 2, run the action that RGB light turns on blue;

![](media/8ac317c9be49c3991f7a524af0147f83.png)

If **count** is greater than and equals to 3, then set the count to 0, run the action that RGB light turns on red;

![](media/ac2f2fe0dc796d44bece5340482907d9.png)

**Result**

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable. You can right-click the microbit HEX file to send to your micro:bit main board.

![](media/202ffa544c2545757a183a4649ad34ce.png)

Done uploading the code, the RGB module will turn on red;

Tap the capacitive touch module with your finger, RGB will turn green; tap the touch area, turn on blue; tap again, turn on red. It will form a loop.

**Coding**

So now let's move to coding. Let us see how to code the passive buzzer to alarm when PIR motion module detects someone moving nearby.

Below are some steps to follow.

Open the [https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) to write your code.

Microsoft MakeCode is actually a platform that allows us to code for a micro:bit, and also provides an interactive simulator where we can debug and run our code, and will be able to see what to expect out right there on the site.

Go to MakeCode and choose **My Projects** and click on **New Projects**.

If you want to see the codes behind, then you can click on JavaScript and it will display JavaScript code there in IDE.

**Motion Alarm**

Let's get started with triggering the buzzer sound. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(false)** into **on start** block.

![](./media/image-20230413155432269.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Logic** and search for **if (true) then...else...**block.

Drag this logic conditional block into **forever** block. And add a comparison block to the logic conditional block.

![](media/33d4fe1e5f660ea316d2061d416dc0e8.png)

![](./media/image-20230413155453530.png)

Go to the **Pins**, drag and drop the **digital read pin(P0)** block into **if (0)=(1) then...else...**block, replacing the “**0**” field.

![](media/de5a1a7498d8e217ff5670ebb35ca505.png)

Look back at the connection diagram, we connect the PIR motion sensor’s signal pin to P1. So change the pin **P0** to **P1.**

Then go to **Music**, drag and drop the block **play tone(Middle C) for (1beat)** and **rest(ms)(1 beat)**

![](media/bbfed2937384c24f17838ede79b1ce9b.png)

If the PIR motion sensor detects someone moving nearby, then the buzzer will play a tone (Middle C); otherwise, buzzer turns off.

![](media/37e088ead35fb6f0875fd8b094baa2d2.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/baf535cfd061573c1b2cb527225aaeac.png)

**Test Code:**

![](./media/image-20230413155518318.png)

**Result**

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable. You can right-click the microbit HEX file to send to your micro:bit main board.

![](media/baf535cfd061573c1b2cb527225aaeac.png)

When someone is moving nearby, the built-in led on PIR motion sensor lights and buzzer will play a tone (Middle C). otherwise, the led is off and buzzer not sounds.

![](./media/image-20230413155544336.png)

## **Project 25: Make A Tone**

**Overview**

In the above projects, we’ve introduced each sensor module. We now combine those sensor modules to make interactive projects.

In this project, you will learn how to make a buzzer play different tones based on the measured analog value of both ambient light and microphone sound.

**Components Required:**

-   Micro:bit main board \*1

-   Keyestudio Passive Buzzer Module for micro:bit \*1
    
-   Keyestudio TEMT6000 Light Module for micro:bit \*1

-   Keyestudio Microphone Module for micro:bit \*1

-   Alligator clip cable*9
    
-   USB cable \*1

**Connection Diagram**

Insert firmly the micro:bit main board into keyestudio Edge Connector IO Breakout Board. Then connect the sensor module to micro:bit main board with alligator clip lines.

For keyestudio Passive Buzzer Module, connect Ring S to P0, V to 3V, G to GND.

For keyestudio TEMT6000 Light Module, connect Ring S to P1, V to 3V, G to GND.

For keyestudio Microphone Module, connect Ring S to P2, V to 3V, G to GND.

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable.

![](./media/image-20230413155848355.png)

**Coding**

So now let's move to coding. Let us see how we can code buzzer sound according to the analog value of both TEMT6000 light module and microphone module. Below are some steps to follow.

Open the [https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) to write your code.

Microsoft MakeCode is actually a platform that allows us to code for a micro:bit, and also provides an interactive simulator where we can debug and run our code, and will be able to see what to expect out right there on the site.

Go to MakeCode and choose **My Projects** and click on **New Projects**.

![](media/4de590a8489963cb1b0bf67cb20dd415.png)

**Ring Tone**

Let's get started with playing tones. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(false)** into **on start** block.

![](./media/image-20230413155930639.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

Next, go to **Serial**, drag and drop the block **serial write value(x)=(0)** into the **forever** block and duplicate once.

In this way it can write both brightness and sound value to the serial port and show it on monitor.

![](media/289be0ae6122b49e6e791acbf5d4a262.png)

Separately change the “**x**” to **brightness** and **noise**;

And drag out the block **analog read pin(P0)** from **Pins** to replace the “**0**” field.

According to the connection, microphone module’s signal pin is connected to P2; light module’s signal pin is connected to P1.

So we should write as follows:

![](media/b5e824b3bc7656d2076223cd7e180ce3.png)

Now by followed, we are ready to add Loops and logic comparison function.

![](media/fc9c990ec8aceef0a75f5d0ddbad362e.png)

![](media/a21f3ca75e3217e7fab43f08043daf96.png)

Supposed that both light and MIC analog value are smaller than or equal to 100, buzzer not beeps. How should we code?

First drag the **while(true)...do** block out from the **Loops**. Then add the Boolean and Comparison logic statements.

![](media/9de4f9c6770de7cd399931b077f0b245.png)

![](media/293cad1aa20498c434b8f082aa5e05fd.png)

We duplicate and drag the Comparison block into Boolean block.

![](media/16a86a0183371e852160578a759e0cd8.png)

Then drag this block into the **while(true)...do** block, replacing the “**true**” field. And again duplicate the block **analog read pin(P1)** and the block **analog read pin(P2)** and drag them into the first input. Set both values smaller than and equal to 100.

While the condition is met, run the action that buzzer not beeps. We can go to drag the **rest(ms)(1 beat)** from **Music** into the while block just made.

![](media/39cd809bea097b1e7f89587c67dd8387.png)

Now we’ve set both light and MIC analog value are smaller than or equal to 100, buzzer not beeps. As shown below.

![](media/2dcadc6a3c6e6a0f5c6e71d12d0300a2.png)

Furthermore, if we want to add several condition statements, be able to duplicate the **while...do...** block several times, and set to different input values to trigger buzzer ring different tones.

Have your try! Write the conditions as follows:

-   When the light analog value is greater than 100, and MIC analog value is smaller than or equal to 100, the buzzer will play a tone (Low B);
    
-   When the light analog value is smaller than or equal to 100, and MIC analog value is greater than 100, the buzzer will play a tone (Middle D);
    
-   When both light and MIC analog value are greater than 100, the buzzer play a tone (High E).

![](media/639b3567ec4d94be88fafaf1f89f29ae.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/5e954716be0d10de05a2ae202e126c9b.png)

**Test Code:**

![](media/47bd48bd1f06849398328b4c28e09ef4.png)

**Result**

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable. You can right-click the microbit HEX file to send to your micro:bit main board.

Done uploading the code, it measures the analog value of ambient light and microphone sound, which can be applied to make a buzzer sound.

When both light and MIC analog value are less than or equal to 100, buzzer not beeps; When the light analog value is greater than 100, and MIC analog value is less than or equal to 100, the buzzer will play a tone (Low B); When the light analog value is less than or equal to 100, and MIC analog value is greater than 100, the buzzer will play a tone (Middle D); When both light and MIC analog value are greater than 100, the buzzer play a tone (High E).

## **Project 26: Use Light to Control RGB**

**Overview**

In the above projects, we’ve introduced each sensor module. We now combine those sensor modules to make interactive projects.

In this project, you will learn how to trigger the RGB light shining colors based on the measured analog value of ambient light.

![](media/c0801e7aeaeaff1a0c488e19f9a36680.jpeg)![](media/df4998f32388d7e4f5ed39dadce17119.jpeg)

**Components Required:**

-   Micro:bit main board \*1

-   Keyestudio TEMT6000 Light Module for micro:bit \*1

-   Keyestudio 5050 RGB Module for micro:bit \*1
    
-   Alligator clip cable \*6

-   USB cable \*1

**Connection Diagram**

Insert firmly the micro:bit main board into keyestudio Edge Connector IO Breakout Board. Then connect the sensor module to micro:bit main board with alligator clip lines.

For keyestudio TEMT6000 Light Module, connect Ring S to P0, V to 3V, G to GND.

For keyestudio RGB LED Module, connect Ring R to P1, G to P2, B to P3, V to 3V.

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable.

![](./media/image-20230413160236635.png)

**Coding**

So now let's move to coding. Let us see how we can code the RGB flash on different colors in different analog value of ambient light.

Below are some steps to follow.

Open the [https://makecode.micro:bit.org/\#editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor) to write your code.

Microsoft MakeCode is actually a platform that allows us to code for a micro:bit, and also provides an interactive simulator where we can debug and run our code, and will be able to see what to expect out right there on the site.

![](media/4de590a8489963cb1b0bf67cb20dd415.png)

**Use Light to Control RGB**

Let's get started with controlling RGB colors with light sensor. To do so, you just need to go to **Basic** and scroll down to see an **on start** block.

Now drag and drop, and go to **Led** and click **more** to drag out the block **led enable(false)** into **on start** block.

![](./media/image-20230413160306927.png)

And again go to **Basic** and drag the **forever** block beneath the on start block you just made.

Then go to **Variables**, search for **set (val) to (0)** block and drag this block into **forever** block.

![](media/9c58e8bbf42e5948358851b05fdae85c.png)

Go to **Pins**, drag and drop the block **analog read pin(P0)** into **set (val) to (0)** block, replacing the “**0**” field.

Look back at the connection diagram, we have connected the TEMT6000 light module to P0; **Red, Green, Blue LED to P1, P2, P3**.

The RGB pins are active at **LOW (record 0)**, which means set to 0 to turn on; so we can set the RGB pins to **HIGH (record 1)** to turn off.

Now we set to print the light value to the serial port using the **serial write number(0)** block from **Serial** and set the logic conditionals.

![](media/35808c4265e9f7f15728eb45b77af2f7.png)

Drag the **val** block from the **Variables** and drop into **serial write number(0),** replacing the “**0**” field.

Then add the logic conditionals block, we go to use light value to turn the RGB LED on.

Now go to **Logic** and search for **if (true) then...**block.

Drag this logic conditionals block beneath the **serial write number** block.

And add a comparison block to the logic conditional block, replacing **(true)**.

![](media/76813c06aa2a96a9016bc8cb693688ab.png)

We set to if val value is less than or equal to 300, then turn Red LED on.

In other word, go to drag and duplicate **digital write pin(P0) to (0)** block twice. For RGB, separately **set Pin1 to 0 (LOW, turn on); Pin2, Pin3 to 1 (HIHG, turn off)**

![](media/a9480041c2e9722a31f93d135a7b7ce5.png)

Furthermore, you can follow the same method to turn on the Green LED or Blue LED.

Set the light value is greater than 300 and less than 800, turn Green LED on;

Set the light value is greater than or equal to 800, turn Blue LED on.

![](media/c2cf57655f39637be40f87e90e382263.png)

After completing the code, let's move on to name and download the program we’ve written.

![](media/ac42ea26c0e0333a863f4f72573d8bea.png)

**Test Code:**

![](./media/image-20230413160356492.png)

**Result**

Connect the micro:bit to your computer with a micro USB cable. You can right-click the microbit HEX file to send to your micro:bit main board.

When analog value of ambient light is less than or equal to 300, RGB light turns on red; when analog value is greater than 300 and less than 800, RGB light turns on green; when analog value is greater than or equal to 800, RGB light turns on blue;
